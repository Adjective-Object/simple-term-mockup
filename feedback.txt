Criticisms:
- error reponse is an exit window?
- people want to hide verbose responses
- Topbar questionably useful

- non clickable elements because it's not a shell convention, and would make moving to other things hard?
- autocompletion with arguments?
	- show most popular args with ... to show there are more flags

- command and responses should probably be the other way around?
	- we read left aligned
	- alex, alec

	- provide emphasis on your commands over the responses
